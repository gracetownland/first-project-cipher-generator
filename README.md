# My Personal Project
This project will be a Cipher text generator.
#### Motivation behind the project
I've always been interested in cryptography and encryption, and I thought I'd take a shot at it for my CPSC210 class:)

## Who would use this project?
Any individual who wants to implement basic cipher techniques for their messages
## Features of this project
- Multiple Cipher techniques.
- All ciphered text can be decrypted provided that the cipher method is known.

 
### User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to run my message through a cipher of my choice. 
- As a user, I want to be able to clearly see the encryption steps in Poly Alphabetic, Substituion and Keyword Ciphers.
- As a user, I want to be able to run an encrypted message through a decrypt function for Poly Alphabetic Cipher and Substituion Ciphers.
- As a user, I want to be able to run one message through multiple encryption algorithms to increase security.
