# My Personal Project
This project will be an Enigma machine simulator.
## Features of this project


- As a user I will be able to key in a message to be encrypted.
- A user can decrypt my message by setting the simulator to the same settings as mine and arrive at the decrypted message
- The encrypted message will be **platform independent**. i.e- it can be decrypted on any enigma machine, real or virtual.
